I figured out how the pose attempts work, which is crucial to show how many times that a yoga pose was attempted. This is beneficial if a member is practing a more difficult asana.

To do list:
- Create a route to log a workout session (similar to pose_performance)
    - Logging is created once the workout session is complete.
- Have to AI base a yoga flow from Claude
    1. Need it to utilize the currently library of yoga flows
    2. Need there to be a 10 minute warm up
    3. Needs there to be a mandatory 5 minute shivasana at the end
    4. Free version only generates a 15 minute scripted flow.

Stretch features:
1. AI agent to generate flow progression and health recommendations.

Claude AI improvements:
    1. Need a JSON that will make workout_session and pose_performance updates
    2. See the other needs above

Go Lang code improvements
- For the yoga_pose model, I will need to add in a left or right depending on the asana

Need to start working on the frontend.
