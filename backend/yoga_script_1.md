## OPENING & CENTERING (3 minutes)

*Speak in a calm, grounded voice*

Welcome to your practice today. Find your way to a comfortable seated position—you might sit cross-legged, or if that doesn't feel right in your body, feel free to sit on a block or even extend your legs out in front of you.

Let your hands rest gently on your thighs or knees, palms facing down to feel grounded, or palms facing up to receive energy.

Close your eyes, or soften your gaze toward the floor.

Begin to notice your breath. Not changing it yet—just observing. Notice the cool air as it enters through your nostrils... and the slightly warmer air as it leaves.

*Pause for 3 breaths*

Start to deepen your breath. Inhale through the nose, letting the belly expand... exhale through the nose, letting it naturally fall.

Set an intention for your practice today. Perhaps it's patience. Perhaps it's strength. Perhaps it's simply showing up for yourself. Hold that intention in your heart.

*Pause for 2 breaths*

Let's begin with three cleansing breaths together. Inhale deeply through the nose... exhale out through the mouth with a gentle sigh. *Demonstrate audible exhale*

Again, inhale... and release. Let go of anything that's not serving you.

One more time, biggest breath yet... and let it all go.

Return to a natural breath through the nose.

## WARM-UP SEQUENCE (7 minutes)

### Seated Neck Rolls & Side Stretches

Keeping your eyes closed, let your chin drop toward your chest. Slowly begin to roll your right ear toward your right shoulder... let the head fall back gently... left ear to left shoulder... and chin returns to chest.

*Continue for 2 full rotations*

Reverse the direction. Chin to chest... left ear to left shoulder... head falls back... right ear to right shoulder... and back to center.

*2 rotations in reverse*

Bring your head back to neutral. Inhale, reach your right arm up overhead. Exhale, plant your left fingertips to the mat and side bend to the left. Feel the entire right side body opening—from hip to fingertips.

*Hold for 3 breaths*

Keep the side bend, but now rotate your chest slightly up toward the ceiling. Breathe into any areas of tightness.

Inhale back to center. Switch sides. Left arm rises... exhale, right fingertips down, side bend to the right.

*Hold for 3 breaths*

Inhale back up to center.

### Tabletop & Cat-Cow

Make your way to tabletop position. Stack your shoulders directly over your wrists, hips over knees. Spread your fingers wide—really root down through the entire hand, especially the space between thumb and index finger.

Inhale for Cow pose: drop the belly, lift the tailbone and the gaze. Draw the shoulders away from the ears.

Exhale for Cat: round the spine up toward the ceiling, tuck the chin, tuck the tailbone. Press the floor away.

*Continue cat-cow for 5 full breath cycles*

Let the breath initiate each movement. The body follows the breath.

*Continue flowing*

Now add some organic movement. Maybe circle through the hips. Maybe sway side to side. Find what feels good in YOUR body this morning.

*30 seconds of free movement*

### Tabletop to Child's Pose Flow

From tabletop, exhale and press your hips back to Child's Pose—Balasana. Knees can be together or wide, whichever feels better for your body. Arms extend forward, forehead rests on the mat.

*Hold for 3 breaths*

Inhale, wave forward to tabletop. Exhale, press back to Child's Pose.

*Repeat 3 times*

On your next inhale forward, tuck your toes and lift your hips up and back to Downward Facing Dog—Adho Mukha Svanasana.

### First Downward Dog

Pedal out your feet here. Bend one knee, then the other. Let the head hang heavy.

Your heels don't need to touch the floor—that's not the goal. Focus instead on lengthening the spine, sending the tailbone up toward the ceiling.

Spread the fingers wide. Press evenly through both hands. Rotate the inner elbows slightly forward.

*Hold for 5 breaths with movement*

Find stillness in your Down Dog. Five breaths here.

*Count 5 breaths*

Exhale, lower down through Chaturanga Dandasana—halfway down, elbows hug in toward the ribs. Only lower as far as you can maintain good form. Beginners, lower all the way to your belly.

Inhale, Upward Facing Dog—Urdhva Mukha Svanasana. Press through the hands, lift the chest, roll the shoulders back. Tops of the feet press into the mat, thighs lift off the ground. Or stay with Cobra—Bhujangasana—keeping hips on the mat.

Every inhale, lengthen. Every exhale, rotate a little more.

### Triangle Pose

Straighten the front leg. Triangle Pose—Trikonasana.

Right hand lowers to shin, ankle, block, or the floor—wherever it lands without compromising the length in your spine. Left arm reaches straight up.

Both legs are straight and strong. Feel as if you're between two panes of glass—everything stays in one plane.

*Hold for 5 breaths*

Inhale, arms reach up, lengthening the spine.

Exhale, hinge at the hips and fold forward—Paschimottanasana. Lead with the chest, not the head.

Grab your shins, ankles, or feet. Or use a strap around the feet.

Extend your arms alongside your body, palms facing up. Shoulders melt into the mat.

Close your eyes.

*Pause*

This is Savasana—Corpse Pose. The most important pose of your practice.

Let the weight of your body be completely supported by the earth beneath you. There is nothing to do. Nowhere to be. Nothing to fix or figure out.

*Pause*

Scan your body from the crown of the head to the tips of the toes. Anywhere you find tension, consciously release it.

Soften the space between your eyebrows. Relax the jaw. Let the tongue fall away from the roof of the mouth.

Release the shoulders. The arms. The hands.

Soften the belly. The hips. The legs.

Let the feet fall heavy.

*Pause for 30 seconds*

Allow your breath to return to its natural rhythm. No need to control it anymore.

*Pause for 30 seconds*

The only thing left to do is rest. To integrate. To allow the benefits of your practice to settle into every cell of your being.

*Remain silent for approximately 2 minutes*

*Begin speaking softly*

Begin to deepen your breath. Draw in a little more air with each inhale.

Start to bring gentle movement back to the body. Wiggle the fingers and toes.

Reach the arms overhead for a full-body stretch. Point the toes. Make yourself long.

*Pause*

Draw the knees into the chest. Rock gently side to side.

Roll to your right side, into a fetal position. Rest here for a moment. The right side represents new beginnings.

*Pause for 3 breaths*

When you're ready, use your top hand to press yourself up to a comfortable seated position. Let the head be the last thing to rise.

Bring your hands to heart center. Bow your head toward your hands.

Take a moment to acknowledge yourself for showing up today. For dedicating this time to your practice. For honoring your body.

The light in me honors the light in you.

Namaste.

*Bow head*

Thank you for practicing with me today.
